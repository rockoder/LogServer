Problem Statement
=================
Write a Logging server which would allow N number of clients to send the LOG message to server. The server should maintain all logs in same log file, prefix with Client-id/name. 

[date] [time] [Client-id/name] This is client X log message

The file integrity is maintained and there should NOT be loss of any log message by any client.

To Build
========
Requires pthread library on the system and compiler with C++11 support. Below script file uses g++ with -std=c++11 option.
./build.sh

To Start Server
===============
cd bin
./server 9999 logfile.txt

To Start Single Client
======================
cd bin
./client 127.0.0.1 9999 1

To Spwan Multiple Clients
=========================
cd bin
for i in {1..10}; do ./client 127.0.0.1 9999 $i & done

To View Log File
================
cd bin
tail -f logfile.txt

Future Enhancements
===================
- Covert server process into deamon
- Write a Makefile
